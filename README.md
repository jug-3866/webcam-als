Ambient Light Sensor through a webcam/camera
## Some Windows Laptop dont come with ambeint light sensors like Macs.
I learned this from having to constantly adjust the brightness on my laptop when moving around. Frustrated I decided to make this.
## How it works?
- Turn off auto exposure and choose an exposure
- Take an image and examine the relative brightness and put it on a scale from 0 to 1
- Use the relative brightness to set the screen brightness
- Loop!
